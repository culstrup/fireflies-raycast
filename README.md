   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
3. Enter your Fireflies API key when prompted (or add it to the `.env` file later)
4. Add the script directory to Raycast

## üìã How to Get Your Fireflies API Key

1. Log in to your Fireflies.ai account
2. Go to [Settings > API](https://fireflies.ai/settings/api)
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key and paste it when prompted during setup (or add to `.env` file)

## üß© Available Commands

Once installed, you'll have access to these commands in Raycast:

- **Fetch Fireflies Transcripts from Chrome**: Copies transcripts from open Chrome tabs
- **Copy Latest Fireflies Transcript**: Copies your most recent Fireflies transcript

## üîß Manual Setup (if not using setup.sh)

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with your Fireflies API key:
   ```
   FIREFLIES_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
4. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.py *.sh
   ```

## üì± Raycast Integration

To add these scripts to Raycast:

1. Open Raycast
2. Go to Extensions > Script Commands
3. Click "Add Script Directory"
4. Select this directory

## üîí Enabling Paste Functionality

To enable automatic pasting:

1. Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility
2. Add Raycast to the list of apps allowed to control your computer

## üí° How It Works

- The scripts use the Fireflies GraphQL API to fetch your transcripts
- For Chrome tab fetching, it uses AppleScript to get URLs from Chrome tabs
- Transcripts are formatted and copied to your clipboard
- If accessibility permissions are granted, it can automatically paste content

## üìù Requirements

- macOS (for AppleScript functionality)
- Python 3.6+
- Raycast
- Google Chrome
- Fireflies.ai account with API access

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you experience issues:
- Check the debug log at `debug.log` in the script directory
- Ensure your API key is correct in the `.env` file
- Verify that you've granted accessibility permissions to Raycast
