# LinkedIn Post for FlyCast Launch

---

üöÄ **Excited to share FlyCast: A tool I built to supercharge my workflow with AI**

As someone who relies heavily on meeting transcripts for context when working with AI tools, I found myself constantly frustrated by the friction in getting Fireflies.ai data into systems like Claude, ChatGPT, and others.

So I built a solution: FlyCast - a simple but powerful bridge between Fireflies meeting transcripts and AI tools.

**What it does:**
‚Ä¢ Instantly copies your latest Fireflies transcript to clipboard
‚Ä¢ Extracts transcripts from all open Chrome tabs with Fireflies links
‚Ä¢ Works seamlessly within Raycast for lightning-fast workflows

**How professionals are using it:**
‚Ä¢ Product teams are using meeting feedback to improve their offerings
‚Ä¢ Sales professionals are getting AI coaching on their calls
‚Ä¢ Executives are drafting comprehensive follow-ups after important meetings
‚Ä¢ Teams are combining multiple meeting transcripts for complete project context

I'm releasing this as an open-source project under my company, GSD at Work LLC. Feel free to use it, modify it, and share how it helps you!

‚û°Ô∏è Check it out on GitHub: https://github.com/culstrup/fireflies-raycast

**Personal note:** I'm particularly excited as this is my first open source project and public GitHub repository! Going from having a problem to solving it with code to sharing that solution with others has been incredibly rewarding.

The fact that modern coding tools made it possible for me to create this so efficiently has been eye-opening. I hope this inspires others to tackle their own productivity challenges and share their solutions too.

If you find it valuable, consider:
