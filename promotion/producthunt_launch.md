Get Fireflies.ai meeting transcripts into AI tools with zero friction

## Description
FlyCast is a simple but powerful Raycast script collection that solves a common problem for professionals: how to quickly get valuable meeting transcripts from Fireflies.ai into your AI tools of choice.

With just a keyboard shortcut, you can:
• Copy your latest transcript
• Extract transcripts from all open Chrome tabs with Fireflies links

This brings the context-rich data from your meetings directly into tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or any other AI assistant—without the typical copy-paste dance.

Common use cases include:
• Drafting follow-up emails that capture all key points
• Getting AI feedback on your sales calls or negotiations
• Turning user feedback into actionable product improvements
• Creating comprehensive proposals based on client discussions
• Providing complete meeting context to your AI tools

It's open source (MIT license) and free to use, with a Ko-fi link for those who want to support further development.
