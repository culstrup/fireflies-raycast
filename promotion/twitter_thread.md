üöÄ Introducing FlyCast: The missing link between @Fireflies_ai transcripts and your favorite AI tools!

I built this to solve a real problem: getting meeting transcripts into AI systems with minimal friction.

## Tweet 2:
When working with AI assistants, context is king. Meeting transcripts are gold mines of context, but they're usually trapped in siloed tools.

FlyCast fixes this by letting you grab transcripts from @Fireflies_ai and instantly use them with @OpenAI, @Anthropic, or any other AI.

## Tweet 3:
Two simple commands in @raycastapp:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Copy your latest transcript
2Ô∏è‚É£ Copy transcripts from all open Chrome tabs

That's it. No more copy-pasting URLs or clicking through multiple pages.
